## Available Functions and Control Systems

In the provided source code, you have access to several functions and libraries that facilitate the implementation of your control system. While this guide highlights some key functions below, it's important to consult the official library documentation for a comprehensive list and detailed usage instructions.

### Available Functions

**Note:** This is a selection of commonly used functions. For a complete list and detailed explanations, please refer to the official documentation of the [QTRSensors](https://github.com/pololu/qtr-sensors-arduino) and [L298N](https://github.com/AndreaLombardo/L298N) libraries.

1. **Motor Control Functions:**

   - `motorA.setSpeed(speed)` and `motorB.setSpeed(speed)`: Set the speed of motors A and B (0-255).
   - `motorA.forward()` and `motorB.forward()`: Set motors to move forward.
   - `motorA.backward()` and `motorB.backward()`: Set motors to move backward.
   - `motorA.stop()` and `motorB.stop()`: Stop the motors.
   - `motorA.runFor(duration, direction)` and `motorB.runFor(duration, direction)`: Run motors for a specific duration in a given direction. (`direction` can be `L298N::FORWARD` or `L298N::BACKWARD`)

2. **Sensor Configuration and Reading Functions:**

   - `qtr.setTypeRC()`: Configure the QTRSensors to use reflection sensors.
   - `qtr.setSensorPins(const uint8_t pins[], uint8_t count)`: Assign digital pins to the sensors.
   - `qtr.setEmitterPin(pin)`: Assign a digital pin to control the sensor emitters.
   - `qtr.emittersOn()`: Turn on the sensor emitters.
   - `qtr.calibrate()`: Calibrate the sensors by finding minimum and maximum values.
   - `qtr.readLineBlack(uint16_t sensorValues[])`: Read the position of a black line on a white surface based on sensor values.
   - `qtr.read(sensorValues[])`: Read raw sensor values.
   - `qtr.readCalibrated(sensorValues[])`: Read calibrated sensor values.

3. **Utility Functions:**

   - `constrain(value, min, max)`: Constrain a value between a minimum and maximum.
   - `map(value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh)`: Map a value from one range to another.
   - `pinMode(pin, mode)`: Configure a digital pin as `INPUT` or `OUTPUT`.
   - `digitalWrite(pin, value)`: Write a `HIGH` or `LOW` value to a digital pin.
   - `Serial.begin(baudrate)`: Initialize serial communication at the specified baud rate.
   - `Serial.print(data)` and `Serial.println(data)`: Send data to the serial monitor.

### Control Systems to Consider

Implementing an effective control system is crucial for the precise operation of your robot. Below are some control systems you might consider:

1. **Bang-Bang Control:**

   - **Description:** The simplest form of control where the robot makes binary decisions (e.g., turn left or right) based on its position relative to the line.
   - **Pros:** Easy to implement.
   - **Cons:** Can result in jerky movements and oscillations.

2. **Proportional Control (P):**

   - **Description:** Adjusts motor speeds proportionally to the error (distance from the line center), resulting in smoother movements compared to Bang-Bang Control.
   - **Pros:** Smoother control than Bang-Bang.
   - **Cons:** May still exhibit steady-state error or oscillations.

3. **Proportional-Integral Control (PI):**

   - **Description:** Combines proportional control with an integral term to eliminate steady-state errors by accounting for accumulated past errors.
   - **Pros:** Reduces steady-state error.
   - **Cons:** More complex to tune; can introduce oscillations if not properly configured.

4. **Proportional-Integral-Derivative Control (PID):**

   - **Description:** Incorporates proportional, integral, and derivative terms to provide comprehensive control, predicting future errors and dampening oscillations.
   - **Pros:** Highly accurate and stable; smoothest control.
   - **Cons:** Most complex to implement and tune.

5. **Fuzzy Logic Control:**

   - **Description:** Utilizes fuzzy set theory to handle uncertainty and make decisions based on fuzzy logic rules.
   - **Pros:** Intuitive design; effective for non-linear systems.
   - **Cons:** Can be computationally intensive; requires defining fuzzy rules.
